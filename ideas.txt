TODOs:

Implement Gaussian Kernel to get Density estimates. 
Implement U-Net to get counts
Try different settings; it might be easier to begin with the owl dataset.

-- Each dot needs to be a gaussian kernel then all densities need to be normalized that the sum equals to the true count
Then train a regression model to estimate the count based on the density map:
